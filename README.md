# **Apple Website Clone**

## **Overview**
This project is a front-end web development exercise aimed at building a clone of the Apple website using HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages. The primary goal is to recreate the look, feel, and functionality of the Apple site by structuring content with HTML semantic elements and styling it using CSS concepts such as flexbox, grid, and media queries. The completed site will be fully responsive across various device sizes.

## **Contributing**
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements, new features, or encounter issues, feel free to submit a pull request or raise an issue.

## **Acknowledgments**
This project is inspired by the Apple website and serves as a hands-on opportunity to apply HTML, CSS, and responsive design skills by developing a real-world website clone.

## **Happy coding! ðŸš€**
